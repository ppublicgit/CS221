\section{System Overview}
The purpose of this assignment is to provide a simple and easy way
to access an employee record database. The database consists of three
classes, an employee record class, store class and customer list class.
The employee record class must store an employee ID,
employee name, department, annual salary of each employee, a pointer to a left and right employee record and a customer list for
supported stores by each employee. The store class stores a pointer to the next store
object (for the customer list) as well as the store id, name, address, city, state and zip code.
The customer list stores a list of stores ordered by store id. An employee database that stores an input data file
and a pointer to the root of a tree for employee records.
