\section{System Overview}
The purpose of this assignment is to provide a simple and easy way
to access an employee record class. The class must store an employee ID,
employee name, department and annual salary of each employee. The class
will eventually be ported to an employee database.

\section{Referenced Documents}

Software Design Document for the Emplyoee Record Database program.

\section{Test Procedures}
The following tests will be performed on the software before its release.
\subsection{Source File: EmployeeRecord.h and EmployeeRecord.cpp}
\subsubsection{Function: EmployeeRecord()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the EmployeeRecord constructor is working correctly.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
First, a call to the default constructor. Then a call to constructor that takes all inputs.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record to be initialized to the default state or the input initialized state
depending on the call made to the constructor.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The employee record will be checked by calling the constructor and then comparing its state with
calls to all the get methods as well as printRecord(). All should match the expected values that
were set by either the default or input initialized constructor calls.

\subsubsection{Function: ~EmployeeRecord()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the destructor for the employee record class is working properly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with all values already set.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record class to properly deallocate memory from all internal variables.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
Initialize multiple employee record classes and destruct them. Make sure that memory for the program does
not keep increasing after employee records are destroyed.

\subsubsection{Function: getID()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the getId() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with employee id set to a known integer value.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record's currently set value.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The int returned by getID() matches the int value set for the employee id.

\subsubsection{Function: setID()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the setId() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with employee id set to a known integer value.
Employee record's id  will then be set to a new value.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record's new int value to be returned by getID().
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The int returned by getID() matches the int value set for the employee id.

\subsubsection{Function: getName()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the getName() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with employee first name and last name set to known character
array values.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record's currently set values for the first and last name.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The character arrays passed into getName to be changed to the current values
for the employee record's first and last names.

\subsubsection{Function: setName()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the setName() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with employee first name and last name set to known
character array values.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record's first name and last name to be changed to the first and
last name passed to the function.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The employee record's first and last name to start at one known value, be set by the call
to the function and the values copied by getName() to match those passed by setName().

\subsubsection{Function: getDept()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the getDept() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with employee department set to a known integer value.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record's currently set department value to be copied into the reference variable
passed into the function.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The int value copied into the passed reference variable to match the int value of the employee record's
department value.

\subsubsection{Function: setDept()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the setDept() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with employee department set to a known integer value.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record's department value to be set to the new value passed by the call of the method
setDept().
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The department to start as a known integer, be set to a new integer value, and the subsequent call
to getDept() to match the value of its referenced argument with that of the value passed to setDept().

\subsubsection{Function: getSalary()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the getSalary() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with employee salary set to a known integer value.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record's currently set salary value.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The double copied into the pointer by getID() matches the double value for the current employee's sacurrent value for the employee's salary.

\subsubsection{Function: setSalary()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the setSalary() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with employee salary set to a known integer value.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
The employee record's salary to be set to the new salary.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
The salary to start as a known double, be set to a new double value, and the subsequent call
to getSalary() to match the value of its pointer argument with that of the value passed to setDept().

\subsubsection{Function: printRecord()}
\subsubsubsection{Purpose and procedure}
This test will determine if the printRecord() function is working correctly. A test
employee record already set will be supplied.
\subsubsubsection{Inputs}
An employee record class with all of its member variables set to known values.
\subsubsubsection{Expected Output}
Proper display of employee record to screen.
\subsubsubsection{Success Criteria}
All member variables to be properly printed to screen with their known values.
